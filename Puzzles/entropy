Hal Pomeranz is forwarding me his email again. What are these lines doing, and why does the second line behave so oddly?

  Subject: No entropy?

  Hey Hal,


  We got a fun submission recently to our vulnerability rewards program that
  I thought I'd share with you.

  The submitter claimed that our virtual machines had low entropy and that we
  therefore weren't properly seeding /dev/urandom and were returning
  non-random values.

  Here's their repro steps:

  $ tr -dc [:graph:] < /dev/urandom | head -c 64 | xargs -0 > a
  $ tr -dc [:graph:] < /dev/urandom | head -c 64 | xargs -0
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

  After scratching our heads for a while about what the hell was going on
  with /dev/urandom, we finally had our AH HA moment.  Can you spot what's
  causing this "vuln"?  ;)
