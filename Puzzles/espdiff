On Ubuntu, the game /usr/games/espdiff is a shell script. How's it work?
(If you're running another distro, you may need to install "patchutils".)
How would you re-write it to clean it up or enhance it?

If you're really pleased with the result, contribute your enhancements. You can find the package maintainer with "man espdiff" .
