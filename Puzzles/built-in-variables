The bash man page is a font of wisdom.

(1) What does "declare -p RANDOM" tell you about the variable?

(2) "echo $RANDOM" reads the value of RANDOM
What happens when you write to it? (Even if you read it, try it.)

(3) We use PS4='[$(date +%T)] ' to time scripts.
Find another way by looking at the bash man page section on "PROMPTING"

(4) Write a program to see whether these two ways have different speeds.
