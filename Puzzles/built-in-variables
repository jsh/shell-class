The bash man page is a font of wisdom.

(1) What does "declare -p RANDOM" tell you about the variable RANDOM?

(2) "echo $RANDOM" reads the value of RANDOM
What happens when you write to it? (Don't just read the man page, try it.)

(3) You've seen PS4='[$(date +%T)] ' as a way to time scripts.
Find another way by looking at the bash man page section on "PROMPTING"

(4) Write a script to see whether these two ways have different speeds.
