In early shells, there was no comment character. Instead, folks used the colon command.

  : here is a comment

() Does this still work? How?

() What's the difference between this

  # put <filename> here

and this?

  : put <filename> here

() Why does there have to be a space between ':' and "put <filename> here"?
Why doesn't there have to be a space between '#' and "put <filename> here"?

() This is a common idiom. What's it doing?

  : ${foo:=bar}

() Ditto for this.

  while : ; do echo yes; done

() How could you use this?

  : <<__EOF__
  command1
  command2
  command3
  __EOF__

() This is useful, too. Why?

  set -x
  : === Kilroy was here
  date

() This is a comment

  ##### Big comment #####

  Why isn't this?
