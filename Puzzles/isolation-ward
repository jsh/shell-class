One way to organize a large script is to put pieces into a single directory,
with a top-level driver to execute or source them.

What command will adjust the path of the top-level script to permit this?

Example:

  $ cat bs/piece1
  #!/bin/bash
  echo this is piece 1

  $ cat bs/piece2
  echo this is piece 2

  $ bs/bigscript
  this is piece 1
  this is piece 2
  $ mv bs /tmp # absolute invocation path should work
  $ /tmp/bs/bigscript
  this is piece 1
  this is piece 2
  $ pushd /tmp/bs; PATH+=: # find it in the current directory
  $ bigscript
  this is piece 1
  this is piece 2
  $ cat /bigscript
  #!/bin/bash

  # How can we set the path in the script to make this work?
  PATH=?????

  piece1
  source piece2
