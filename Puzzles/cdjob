Background jobs are great. But what if I need more commands that know about them than the shell gives me out-of-the-box?

(1) Write a function that does a cd to a numbered job.

  $ git clone git@git-server:myproject.git      # check out a mass of code
  $ cd myproject; make &> make.OUT &            # kick off a massive build
  [1] 19096
  $ cd /here; cd /there; cd /and-everywhere     # wander around doing other errands while it works 
  # Let's go look back to how the make is progressing
  $ cdjob %1
  $ tail -f make.OUT

(2) Why does it have to be a function?
