Doug Miller asked me what shell questions I'd suggest asking a job candidate -- not an expert, just someone who knows the basics.

I suggested showing candidates this script:

  #!/bin/bash
  for i in $*; do
    [ -f $i ] && mv $i $i.bak
  done

and then asking questions like this:

  (1) What's the first line do, and does it have a name?
  (2) What's the "for i in $*" do?
  (3) What's the [ -f $i ] do?
  (4) What's the && do?
  (5) What's the script do?
  (6) What can go wrong with it, and so what tests would you write for it?
  (7) Extra credit 0: If something does go wrong, what's the script's exit status?  And if nothing does?  How can you learn its exit status?
  (8) Extra credit 1: How would you re-write this script to improve it?
  (9) Extra credit 2: What single command could you use instead of this script?
  (10) Extra credit 3: Who wrote it?

What would you ask?
