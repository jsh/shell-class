Sometimes, you have a choice between an executable in the filesystem, like which(1),
and a shell built-in, like "type -p". How much difference can the choice make?

(1) Time the differences.
time for i in /usr/bin/*; do which $(basename $i); done > /dev/null
time for i in /usr/bin/*; do type -p $(basename $i); done > /dev/null

(2) How much overhead does is the loop+print contribute?
time for i in /usr/bin/*; do echo $(basename $i); done > /dev/null

(3) Write your own version of which, entirely in the shell.

Hint: echo ${PATH//:/ }
Hint: What does a colon at the beginning or end of your path mean? Are you taking that into account? What about "::"?

(4) What do these tell you?

  $ type which
  $ type type
  $ which which
  $ which type
