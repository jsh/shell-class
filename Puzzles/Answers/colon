  : here is a comment

() Does this still work? How?

A: Yep. : is a builtin synonym for true.
"here is a comment" is an arg, which is ignored.

() What's the difference between this

  # put <filename> here

and this?

  : put <filename> here

A: '<' and '>' are I/O redirections to the ':' command, which will read from file "filename" , and truncate file "here".

() This is a comment

  ##### Big comment #####

  Why isn't this?

  ::::: Big Comment :::::

A: There is no command ":::::"

() This is a common idiom. What's it doing?

  : ${foo:=bar}

A: Setting $foo to bar if foo is null or unset, as a side effect.

() Ditto for this.

  while : ; do echo yes; done

A: It's an infinite loop.

() How could you use this?

  : <<__EOF__
  command1
  command2
  command3
  __EOF__

A: commenting out blocks of code.

() This is useful, too. Why?

  #!/bin/bash -eux

  : === Kilroy was here
  date

A: Inserts comments in the script's output.
