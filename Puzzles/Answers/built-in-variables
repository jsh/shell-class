The bash man page is a font of wisdom.

(1) What does "declare -p RANDOM" tell you about the variable? Is it read-only?

  $ declare -p RANDOM
  declare -i RANDOM="5896"

It's an integer variable, but *not* read-only.

(2) "echo $RANDOM" reads the value of RANDOM
What happens when you write to it? (Even if you found the answer in the man page, try it.)

  $ RANDOM=1
  $ echo $RANDOM
  16807

(3) We use PS4='[`$(date +%T)`] ' to time scripts.
Find another way by looking at the bash man page section on "PROMPTING"
PS4='[\t] '

(4) Write a program to see whether these two ways have different speeds.

#!/bin/bash -eux

exec &> $0.OUT

PS4='[\t] '

time for i in {0..100000}; do
  true
done 
echo first

PS4='[$(date +%T)] '

time for i in {0..100000}; do
  true
done
echo second

3 seconds vs. 10 minutes: a 200-fold slowdown for the version that forks a subshell.
