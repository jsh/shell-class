For me, pick-v1 is easier to read.
It's also less subject to maintenance drift. (The more lines there are, the more things there are to get wrong.)

Another big difference is speed. Try timing 1000 iterations.

Between pick-v1 and pick-v3, I think the choice is less clear. Sequestering one-pick into a function increases readability in some ways.
