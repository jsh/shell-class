On the Boulder Linux Users Group (BLUG) mailing list, Paul Nowosielski asks

  I'm trying to convert all the html files
  into text using lynx. The files are in many directories
  with meaningful names.

  Can anyone assist me in creating a script
  That will go through each directory recursively
  and convert the files to text and preserve the base name.

  ex: file1.html file1.txt file2.html file2.txt (or something close to this)

Make that "somebody" be you: write the one-liner on the command line.
(You can be even more useful by giving him a second one-liner to create a test directory full of files to run it on.)

Hint:

  This one-liner converts foo.html to foo.txt

    lynx -dump -nolist foo.html > foo.txt
