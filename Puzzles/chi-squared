For the statistically-minded:

We generated 100000 random integers from 1..49 with this:

for i in {1..100000}; do echo $((RANDOM%49+1)); done | sort -n | uniq -c 

You can test goodness-of-fit to a discrete, uniform distribution U(1,49) with a simple, chi-squared test.

chi-squared = Sum[ (observed - expected)^2/expected ]

The mean of the chi-squared here would be 48 (the degrees-of-freedom), and the variance, twice that. (Standard deviation is the square root of the variance).

To make the arithmetic easier, expand the range to 0..50, then test for uniformity on the command line.
