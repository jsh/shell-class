Each of these scripts does the same thing. 

(1) Read each script to understand how it works; convince yourself that
if you come across loops like these in someone else's script, you can
figure out what they're doing.

(2) Are they all about the same speed? You can time them like this:

  $ time for i in {1..1000}; do ./l1 ; done > /dev/null

(3) How's the speed change if you don't send the output to /dev/null?

(4) How much of the timing loop, above, is overhead from the test itself?

(5) Write a script to do the loop some other way. Why's your new way better? Why's it worse?
