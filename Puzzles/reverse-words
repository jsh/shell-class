My birthday, November 21, is officially "World Hello Day."

Write a filter that turns "hello world" into "world hello" .

In more detail, take each input line and reverse the words.

Example:

  $ cat <<__EOF__ | worldhello

  
  my name is Yoda
  this is good

  __EOF__
  
  Yoda is name my
  good is this

Write an improved version that just puts the last word first

  $ cat <<__EOF__ | worldhello

  
  my name is Yoda
  this is better

  __EOF__
  
  Yoda my name is
  better this is
