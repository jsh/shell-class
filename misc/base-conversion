You could do this.

for (( i=0; i<0x20; i++ ))
do
    printf "\t%x\n" $i
done

But why not this?

for i in {1..32}   # or $(seq 0x20)
do
    printf "\t%x\n" $i
done

To paraphrase someone (Dijkstra?): 

A good C programmer can write C in any language, at least when POSIX requires he be able to do so.  :-)
