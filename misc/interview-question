For Doug Miller.

#!/bin/bash
for i in $*; do
  [ -f $i ] && mv $i $i.bak
done

  I might ask some or all of:

  (1) What's the first line do, and does it have a name?
  (2) What's the "for i in $*" do?
  (3) What's the [ -f $i ] do?
  (4) What's the && do?
  (5) What's the script do?
  (6) What can go wrong with it, and so what tests would you write for it?
  (7) Extra credit 0: If something does go wrong, what's the script's exit status?  And if nothing does?  How can you learn its exit status?
  (8) Extra credit 1: how would you re-write this script to improve it?
  (9) Extra credit 2: What single command could you use instead of this script?
