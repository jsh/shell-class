#Second, how can I do this more cleanly?
#One answer, fwiw, is this:

export ANDROID_HOME=$(find /usr/share -type d -name android-sdk-linux_x86)

# "What if it's several levels down so I don't really want it?"
# "What if there's a /usr/share/yo_mama/android-sdk-linux_x86?" 
# What if I get hit by a falling meteor?
