Let's look at what we've done:

Written a program.
Fast.
The editor came last.
Each step did something.
Each step, we could see the results.

Some conventional things:
Control flow. Variables.

Some not-so-conventional:
Pipes. Such a big deal.
Subshells called almost in passing.
These are sort-of unnamed functions -- "closures," if you want to get all computer-sciency.

Some things are unimportant:
Syntax. You'll catch on. Some of it's historical and crappy.
Built-ins -- variables, like $RANDOM, and built-ins, like echo.

Some things are important:
Writing shell programs is like Tinkertoys, or Legos.
Pieces aren't libraries or toolkits, they're programs.
The fundamental datum is a file.
What's a file? A sequence of lines. What's a line? A sequence of words.

This is a gimme for von-Neumann-model programming: Shell scripts are files. Programs are data.

We'll pause here. I'll come back to this example. We're not done with it. Not even close.
