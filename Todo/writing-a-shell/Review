You understand what a shell is.

A shell's a program that reads a line at a time and does it.

You could write a shell.
Lots of people do.
	Paul Falstad wrote zsh as a grad student
	Chet Ramey maintains bash and did most of it.
	Ken Almquist wrote ash, which is used in BSD distros. Many embedded-Linux distros use "Debian ash" or "dash." A bunch o' folks wrote tcsh, the "Tenex C-shell."
	Bill Joy wrote csh as a grad student. He also wrote vi, the first screen editor.
	Steve Bourne wrote the Bourne shell (/bin/sh) while a DEC employee
	Ken Thompson wrote Unix in four weeks, while his wife was in California.
	One week was his sh
	My mother created jsh in 9 months.

You know how this fits into the OS
  OS = File tree + Process tree
