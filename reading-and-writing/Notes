Redirection

> and < are funnels


Piping

first_program | second_program

is not the same as

first_program > /tmp/$$
second_program < /tmp/$$
rm /tmp/$$

You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand this? And radio operates exactly the same way: you send signals here, they receive them there. The only difference is that there is no cat.
    Albert Einstein

An example

We start with some new syntax

echo $(( 2+2 ))
echo $(( 10/2 ))
echo $(( 10%2 ))
echo $(( $RANDOM % 2 ))
for i in {1..10}; do echo $(( RANDOM%2 )); done
for i in {1..10}; do echo $(( RANDOM%2 )); done | grep 0
for i in {1..10}; do echo $(( RANDOM%2 )); done | grep 0 | wc -l
for i in {1..100}; do echo $(( RANDOM%2 )); done | grep 0 | wc -l
for i in {1..1000}; do echo $(( RANDOM%2 )); done | grep 0 | wc -l
for i in {1..1000000}; do echo $(( RANDOM%2 )); done | grep 0 | wc -l

See how big those temporary files would be? For pipes, there are none.
