Before you take this class, you need to

- bring a Unix- or Linux- or OS/X laptop you can use.

- know how to use some text editor, how to launch a terminal window, and how to type.

- be running sh, dash, bash, ksh, zsh, or some other POSIX-y shell.

- program. I don't mean "be a kernel hacker," but I don't mean "click icons" or "write HTML."

- get a free, GitHub account and figure out how to put stuff up there.

If you don't have these prerequisites, you'll waste your time and everyone else's. You can get these prereqs at some other class, then come.
