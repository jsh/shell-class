Forgetting that cron doesn't know my login settings.
----------------------------------------------------


  I (all too) often forget that cron jobs don't have my environment, and may
  not even have my shell.

  I solve this by having a crontab like this:

      $ crontab -l
      ## my crontab

      SHELL=/bin/bash
      PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:~/bin
      BASH_ENV=/home/jsh/.bash_env
      MAILTO=jeffrey.haemer@gmail.com

      # minute (0-59)
      # |      hour (0-23)
      # |      |      day of the month (1-31)
      # |      |      |    month of the year (jan-dec)
      # |      |      |    |     day of the week (sun-mon, with 0=sun)
      # |      |      |    |     |        command
      # |      |      |    |     |        |
      #
        0     23      *    *     *        crontab -l > ~/bin/crontab.txt 2>/dev/null
        ...



  My .bash_env is typically a link to .bashrc.  Bash sources $BASH_ENV at
  startup when it's a non-interactive, non-login shell.

  (I save my crontab every night because it's under source-code management, so
  I can recover it when I break it, or find old versions with things I want to
  do again.)
