svn status mysrc | grep '^?' | cut -c8- | \
  while read FN; do echo "$FN"; rm -rf "$FN"; done

  Your solutions are just fine, and illustrate "Looping with a read."
  Still, fwiw, I do this really a lot, but like this:

    svn stat mysrc |  perl -ne 'print if s/^\?//' | xargs rm -rf

  or this:

    svn stat mysrc | awk '/^?/{$1=""; print}' | xargs rm -rf

  or even this:

    rm -rf $(svn stat mysrc | awk '/^?/{$1=""; print}')

  The reason is the way I program.  I start out doing svn stat mysrc.  If it
  gives the output I expect, I recall it and add the pipeline.  If that gives
  me a list I expect, I recall it and add the removal.
