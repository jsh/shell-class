while (( 1 ))
{
  ...
} ->
  while (( 1))
  do
    ...
  done

  (And yes, it works, but it'll be useful to mention that they'll see this
  in scripts:

    while true
    do
      ...
      some_termination_condition && break
      ...
    done



cat file.intput | \
while
do
  ...
done

  ->

  cat file.input |
  while
  do
    ...
  done

  This may or may not be a "useless use of cat" .  It's certainly a "useless
  use of backslashes." :-)
