Gentlemen,

Nice book!

I put it on my Amazon.com wish list, and got it for Christmas.  I've seen shell
programming books that suck.  This doesn't.  I've seen shell-programming books
that were too elementary.  This isn't.  I've seen shell-programming books that
were mostly manuals.  Not this one.

Good job.

I attach comments about some of the individual recipes.
