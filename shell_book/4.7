Bash nohups background jobs.  Try this from a new terminal window.

  { sleep 20; echo DONE > /tmp/OUT; } & sleep 1; exit

The "sleep 1" ensures the shell will parse everything and start up the
other sleep correctly.

The terminal window will close, and, 19 seconds later, the automatically
nohup'd process will write "DONE" to /tmp/OUT.
