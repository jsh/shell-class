don't count on short circuits in conditionals.  If you need that kind of behavior, just break the if statement into two nested if statements.

if [ -z "$V1" -o -z "${V2:=YIKES}" ] ->
  if [ -z "$V1" ] || [ -z "${V2:=YIKES}" ]

  This solves the problem without a lot of nesting.  Plus, it's easier for me
  to think about this when we break the complex test into separate tests.

  The second test is always false, so the body will only be executed if the
  first test is true.  This lets us write it like this:

  if [ -z "$V1" ]
  then
    conditional-stuff
  else
    ${V2:=YIKES}
  fi

As mentioned in 6.3, this can be made a little easier to read by reversing the
test.

  if [ "$V1" ]
    ${V2:=YIKES}
  else
    conditional-stuff
  fi
