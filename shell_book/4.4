  To illustrate numbered-jobs, here's a function I use when I have several
  background jobs started from work in different places.

  You don't want Perl in your book, so you'd need to turn it into awk.

    # cdjob -- change to the working directory of a numbered job
    #
    # EXAMPLE:
    #
    #     $ cd
    #     $ jobs
    #     [1]+  Running                 vi 4.4  (wd: ~/shell_book)
    #     [2]-  Running                 sleep 400 &  (wd: /tmp)
    #     $ cdjob %2
    #     $ pwd
    #     /tmp

    cdjob () 
    { 
        local d;
        : ${1:?"usage $FUNCNAME %N"};
        d=$(jobs $1 | perl -lane 'print "cd $1" if m/.*\(wd: (.*)\).*/');
        test "$d" && eval $d
    }
