let's face it -- that's not going to work for 500 iterations (Yes, you could
nest loops 5x10, but come on!)

  What will work is this:

    for i in {1..500}
    do
      echo $i
    done

  I can't remember ever seeing a "for ((;;))" loop in a script.  Before {a..b},
  I used "seq".

    for i in $(seq 500)
    do
      echo $i
    done

  Though, yeah, some folks used "while"

    i=0
    while (( i++<500 ))
    do
      echo $i
    done
