Which is more clear?

  We see through different eyes.

  The shell will read, line after line, until you finish a syntactic construct.
  Operators like "&&" "||" "&" and "|" are line-continuation characters, just
  like '\'.

  Using this, together with indentation, improves readability by eliminating
  ugly backslashing.

  So, I'd write it like this:

    [ $results ] &&
        echo "Got a good result in $results" ||
        echo "Got an empty result, something's wrong"

  To you, it's bad.  To me, it's optimal.  De gustibus non desputandum est.
  (In matters of taste there is no dispute.)

  More to the point, though, it's idiomatic.  Like C's

      for (;*t++ = *s++;)
        ;
  
  a Cookbook reader should be taught to recognize it.
