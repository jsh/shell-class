  In my scripts, I use a utility function.

  cmd || { printf "%b" "FAILED.\n"; exit 1; } ->
    cmd || die FAILED.


  For ease-of-reading, I ape the names of the Perl functions:

    warn() { [ "$*" ] && echo $* 1>&2 ; }
    die() { warn $*; exit -1; }

  This means I only have to get them right once.
