function calc
{
  awk "BEGIN {print \"The answer is: \" $* }";
}
  ->

    function calc
    {
      printf "$* = "
      awk "BEGIN { print $* }"
    }

  (I prefer this for a couple of reasons.  First, it's got less backslashing --
  less, "How do I do awk quoting inside shell quoting, again?" stuff.

  Second, it gives visual feedback on what it's done that I like better.

  As always, YMMV.)
