There is a similar mechanism for integer arithmetic with shell variables using the bash built-in let statement.

  You've explained l-values and r-values, so it may be simpler to point out
  that "(( expr ))" and "let expr" are the same thing.

  $(( expr )) is just the r-value returned by (( expr )), which you can use in
  something else.

  [ By the way, you could present $() in the same way -- it's the r-value from
  a subshell. ]

  For example, you can say

    COUNT=$((COUNT + 5 + MAX * 2))

  but you can as easily say

    (( COUNT += 5 + MAX * 2 ))

  and you don't have to fuss with spacing, the way you do with "let."

  
$((COUNT +5 MAX * 2))           # middle of page 109, in the discussion
  -> $((COUNT + 5 + MAX * 2))

  (Typo.)
