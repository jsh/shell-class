There may be a few occasions when it is useful to make interactive comments.

  I bet I use interactive comments a dozen times a day -- though not to comment
  my code.

  When I'm in the middle of typing a command, and I need to pause -- say, to
  check a filename or make sure the command is correct-- I put a '#' at the
  beginning of the line and hit ENTER to get a new prompt.  When I'm ready to
  execute it, I recall the line, delete the comment character, and hit ENTER.

  Here's the recipe:

    Vi-mode
      escape pound  [In command-mode, typing a # anywhere on the line comments
      the line and gives you a new prompt.]

    Emacs-mode
      control-A pound ENTER
