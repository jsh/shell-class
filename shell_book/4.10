if [ -f $SCRIPT -a -x $SCRIPT ] ->
  if [ -f $SCRIPT ] && [ -x $SCRIPT ]

  (I break compound test statements into pieces, now that "test" is a builtin.
  It removes the burden of remembering '-a'/'-o', and provides shortcut
  evaluation.  The syntax of "test" can get messy; it's easier to eliminate the
  need to debug it by turning it into shell syntax.)
