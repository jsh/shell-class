We like using the word function because it is very clear and readable

  One caveat: it's not portable.  Works fine for bash, but not for, for
  example, dash.  Dash, the Debian Almquist shell, is the default link to
  /bin/sh on Debian distros, like Ubuntu.

  If you define functions like this

      name() {
        body
      }

  or this

      name () {
        body
      }

  instead of this

      function name() {
        body
      }

  or this

      function name {
        body
      }


  they'll work fine in either.

  On out-of-the-box Debian distros, the second form will produce a syntax
  error.
