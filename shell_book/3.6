[nN0] -> [0Nn] (and [yY1] -> [1yY])

  (In the book's font, 0 and O are easily confused, so "N0" looks like "NO",
  which is momentarily confusing.)

  If the user types y, Y, or Enter, then that date is accepted. ->
    If the user types y, Y, 1, or enter, then that date is accepted.

  (A better chice here might be to drop 1/0 as allowed alternatives.)

printf "%b" "You chose: $CHOICE" ->
  printf "You chose: $CHOICE\n"

  (Two problems: First, it needs a newline.    Second, here and everywhere else
  in the book, you can replace

    printf "%b" "Here's a string\n"

  by the more readable

    printf "Here's a string\n"

  Me, I'd usually use

    echo "Here's a string"

  but YMMV -- your mileage may vary.)
