Next, let's get greedy and buy a lot of lottery tickets.

But what if we want the number we're picking to be an arg?

Let's explore argument parsing a little.

First, let's just look at the args, nothing else.  Here's a simple one.
Note how we print.

x=3
echo x is $x
unset x
echo x is $x
echo x is "$x"  # doesn't work
echo x is '$x'  # really doesn't work
echo "x is '$x'" # aha!
